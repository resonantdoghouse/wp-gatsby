# Gatsby with WordPress as a data source

Clone or download this repo and `npm install`

Change the baseUrl in **gatsby-config.js** to an existing WordPress install

Development & testing
```npm run develop```

To build the project
```npm run build```

*Please note* the navigation is currently hard-coded, I haven't added a dynamic nav build yet, on the TODO.

To edit the navigation links, open index.js in the src/pages folder

## gatsby-starter-default
The default Gatsby starter

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
```
gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```
